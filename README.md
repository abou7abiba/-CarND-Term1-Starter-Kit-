# Ubuntu CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit
This is the starter kit for the Udacity Self-Driving Cars Nano-dgree that is built on Ubuntu 20.04

## 1. My Environment
I have a Laptop that I am using for the development activities and labs with the following specifications.
1. Lenovo ThinkPad W520 with:
    1.  16G RAM
    2.  250G SSD HD
    3.  Intel® Core™ i7-3720QM CPU @ 2.60GHz × 8 
    4.  NVIDIA Corporation GK107GLM [Quadro K1000M] / Quadro K1000M/PCIe/SSE2 GPU with compute compatibility 3.0
2. Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS 64 bit
    1. GNOME v.3.36.3
    2. X11 Windowsing System

## 2. Objective
The objective of this tutorial is to setup a development environment on this environment to execute the labs of the [Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/dashboard/overview). The main objective if this is to utilize my laptop's GPU. 

To do so I started to follow the guidelines to build it provided in the [CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/doc/configure_via_anaconda.md) to build it through the Anaconda environment. I went trough several trials which were not all succeeded. I went through them to give you an indicator if you were following the same path.

## 3. Setup Trials
In Each of these trials I followed some resources that guides me to execute this trial so I will try to list them all and the steps that I followed and the outcome you should see at such step.

### 3.1. Anaconda Trial
In [this trial](trial-1-miniconda.md) I followed the straight guidelines documented to install miniconda and then try to create the environment using the conda command. **This trial failed.**
